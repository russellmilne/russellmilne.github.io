<p>This is the official website of Dr. Russell Milne. I am a postdoctoral researcher in mathematical biology. Currently, I am a member of the Interdisciplinary Lab for Mathematical Ecology and Epidemiology led by Prof. Hao Wang, in the University of Alberta's Department of Mathematics and Statistics. Previously, I did my Ph.D. under Profs. Chris Bauch and Madhur Anand at the University of Waterloo, and my Master's under Prof. Fred Guichard at McGill University.</p>
