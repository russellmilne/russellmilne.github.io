					<p class="main-text">This is the official website of Dr. Russell Milne. I am a postdoctoral researcher in mathematical biology. Currently, I am a member of the Interdisciplinary Lab for Mathematical Ecology and Epidemiology led by Prof. Hao Wang, in the University of Alberta's Department of Mathematics and Statistics. Previously, I did my Ph.D. under Profs. Chris Bauch and Madhur Anand at the University of Waterloo, and my Master's under Prof. Fred Guichard at McGill University.</p>
					<p class="main-text">This middle paragraph is dummy text that I am including so that I know that my edits have been successfully deployed. I have recently changed the behaviour of the scrollbar, specifically making it not show up in the navbar. (This was to prevent the right-aligned navbar items from jumping when a scrollbar was introduced.) Therefore, to check what this box looks like when I have to scroll to see all of the text in it, I am writing a rather long middle paragraph here. This will be slightly different from my previous long paragraph, since I am still testing the scrollbar functionality. The new sentence that I am adding to make the paragraph different is this one, and it is distinguishable by the fact that it contains the word "apple-pear". I will thus write some meaningless filler text. The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. Jackdaws love my big sphinx of quartz. Mr. Jock, TV quiz PhD, bags few lynx. This pangram contains four As, one B, two Cs, one D, thirty Es, six Fs, five Gs, seven Hs, eleven Is, one J, one K, two Ls, two Ms, eighteen Ns, fifteen Os, two Ps, one Q, five Rs, twenty-seven Ss, eighteen Ts, two Us, seven Vs, eight Ws, two Xs, three Ys, one Z.

This is the song that never ends, yes it goes on and on, my friends. Some people started singing it not knowing what it was, but now they'll keep on singing it forever just because this is the song that never ends, yes it goes on and on, my friends.

Some people started singing it not knowing what it was, but now they'll keep on singing it forever just because this is the song that never ends, but I won't be singing it forever because I think I have enough words now to cause the page to start scrolling. Just to make sure, I'll add one more sentence at the end here, which I hope does the trick.</p>
